# UITabBarItem-CustomBadge
Allows you to customize various attributes of the badge on a UITabbar.


Currently supports changing the value, font, text color, background color, diameter and the position.

I originally found the idea for this category at https://github.com/enryold/UITabBarItem-CustomBadge/.

I cleaned the code up a lot and added some extra features.
